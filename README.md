My personal blog, based on the template of https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms. It was tweaked to use TailwindCSS instead of Bulma, as well as the addition of TypeScript.

The Gatsby was also updated to take advantage of router hooks of `@reach/router`.

## Development

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```
