`astrodyne` was a project that I created to try out if it's possible to autogenerate a documentation site using `typedoc` and JSDoc.

While I don't quite maintain it, I find the experience pretty valuable since I learned a lot about `typedoc` and its capabilities. I also discovered that `typedoc` emits pretty complex JSON to represent generic types and conditional types.
