For me, 2020 has been a... memorable yearâ€”in its own way, of course. It is as if yesterday was still 2019, but here we are, at the end of 2020. I encountered a lot of events this year, which were a mix of happiness and sadness inducing events. In this post, I will rank the top 3 achievements and struggles as I paved my way throughout the year.

## Top 3 Achievements

For this achievements section, I want to dedicate it for my effortsâ€”â€”not necessarily have to be tangible. I think it is more leaning towards a change in person, hopefully towards a better one.

### Being Kinder to Myself

I think I did a lot of favor to myself this year. Previously, I was somewhat "hungry"â€”â€”hungry for recognition, hungry for praise, hungry for more money, and all that. However, this year (especially after COVID-19 landed in Indonesia), I tried to take things more slowly for the sake of [my long-term vision](https://peepohappy.id/blog/marriage-and-emotional-affection). I can't be a good father if I am not alive, so there's that.

During the early stages of COVID-19 in Indonesia, I was asked if I wanted to volunteer in an independent group to monitor the COVID-19 progress in Indonesia. It was around March, if I remember correctly. I asked my soon-to-be-wife (at that time) whether I should join or not. We arrived at the decision that preparing for our marriage had bigger priority and if I wanted to accept it, I should consider whether I would be able to juggle between my job, the volunteering, and my own health. Hence, I didn't join the volunteering group.

I think myself in the past would have accepted the offer, which leads to me burning out in the process and ultimately results in my other 2 responsibilities (or possibly all 3) not being properly managed.

### Overcoming Suicidal Thoughts

There were probably 4 times where I was trapped within a vortex of myself. The first one happened around January/Februaryâ€”â€”I had thought of jumped off a [footbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footbridge). That was the point where I felt I needed to visit a therapist... for the first time. I was nervous because I had heard about people's experiences with therapists and mostly they had bad experiences.

It turned out to be a quite pleasant one. I binned some of my psychological garbages and learned some good teachings. The therapist said that I was stuck in my own thoughts because I didn't see that coming. To prevent that, I should be more aware of myself and feel if the "darkness" starts to creep up on me. In addition, she [the therapist] also taught me some meditation techniques, which are incredibly useful until now.

The second one came around 1 month before my marriage. I laid on the floor the whole night until my body felt numb. I didn't check on my phone, I didn't eat. At 3AM the next day, I thought about my soon-to-be-wife (at that moment)â€”we were so close of being together and I didn't want to make her feel sad (although I already did by not replying to her messages). Then, I decided to order a food online to fill out my empty stomach. I didn't do well in my job for 2-3 days since the incident, but I regained my pace eventually.

The third attack came around 1â€“2 months after my marriage. I remembeer back then I just laid on a carpet breathing, but devoid of life. I looked up as I saw the ceiling and my wife crying. We were (and still are) living in an apartment and my mind was conflicting on whether I should rush to the balcony and jump or not. But again, my feelings for my wife triumphed and we spent the rest of the night comforting each other.

The fourth attack was probably the weakest compared to the previous ones. I was quite stressed at that time and we decided to go along to buy some groceries. My mind was fighting between living and intentionally walking on the bus corridor, so I bought 2 sacks of rice (5 kilograms each) and I carried them to the apartment (yes, we usually walk to the nearest supermarket). This was because when I am emotionally unstable, I stabilize myself by "draining" my own energy, hoping that I don't have any energy left to harm myself. It worked and we arrived safely in our apartment.

I am thankful to myself for not giving up in these fights. They were not, by any means, easy. If you are facing the same thing, please stay strong and find someone who can help you carry your "emotional burden".

### Learning About Long-term Investments

Wealth investments
Family investments: expressing love explicitly, saying thanks and sorry

## Top 3 Struggles

### COVID-19

FullStackDay cancelled
Can't really get out in peace
People were on edge, especially in my family

### Family Issues

Before marriage: trying to "remedy" relationship between father and mother which definitely didn't work
Marriage preparation: being constantly compared with older brother which had issues in his marriage
Marriage preparation: the hardship of merging two families
Marriage preparation: even choosing accomodation was hard ðŸ˜…
Being bought a house by parents: more responsibilities, more taxes, less freedom to live wherever we want, and even then the house's blueprint was forced to be created based on "fortune telling". My parents' house was built based on that and look at their family. Yes, the family is wealthy, but they are not happy. Look what happened to my brothers emotionally.

### People Saying that "Relationship between happiness and health is still unclear"

The most ridiculous thing to be ever said. This is because a public figure said that if people are happy [by going out], then they won't get infected by COVID-19 and they will recover faster. This is wrong -- happiness can be found inside the house within your own family. However, the group that I was asked to volunteer [quoted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFEyUDcnstM/) a doctor who said "Relationship between happiness and health is still unclear". It feels like a really inhuman statement, to be honest. He could just counter the public figure's statement by saying "Being happy doesn't have to risk other people's lives by going outside", but sure, he chose a worse one.

If you ever live in the same house with someone who abuses you emotionally [or even physically] a lot, you will be afraid this kind of information reaches that person. They will use it to their advantage, saying that "There are no scientific evidences that happiness can affect health. Stop being so weak, my life in the past was harder than this".

It is even worse because he [and the group] didn't add the suggestion to always "be kind" to each other.

If you know why certain people of certain families want to go outside to find happines, it's probably because they are trying to ESCAPE from their family. If you can stay happy and sane in your home, then that's good, I take it that you have a good life [and maybe a loving family]. But please, try to be considerate of people who don't have that privilege.

I suffered 3 bad fevers (39Â°+) because I was stressed out and unhappy (1 in 2013, 2 in 2020). Those were the worst sicknesses that I ever had because of emotional issues. In other days, usually I just became dizzy, had a headache, or had trouble breathing.
