Before 2021 comes to an end, I want to reflect on what I have done in 2021 so far. This year was yet another tough one in terms of challenges like last year, but thankfully, at the time of writing, it looked like I was going to survive this year.

So... where to start? Let's start from the first half of the year, I guess.

## First half of the year

There were **a lot** of family drama and it kept on coming, despite how tired I was with those nonsenses. Like, I don't know, I wish my mother and my oldest brother would discard their materialistic trait and see the world not only for money.

Since January until at the time of writing, I hadn't met my mother even once. I learned my lesson already. I was a donkey back then for giving my mother **3 chances** to redeem herself. At the end, myself and my wife got hurt emotionally and all that because of my foolishness. No more.

The same goes for my older brother. I was a fool for giving him another chance, when at the end what he did was to attack me when I was not prepared. No more.

There were... another parties who thought that it was that simple to just "simply" visit my mother. This was because the norm here in Indonesia is that parents are respected and children are expected to do their utmost to "satisfy" their parents. One coming from someone whose parents got divorced when they were still a child and some others whose family were functional.

I think it is very hard to "assume" the shoes of another person, especially in the case of families. I grew up in a family that was quite dysfunctional, especially in terms of solving problems. It was very rare that a problem was "solved" cool-headed. It was either not solved or solved _prematurely_ for the sake of stopping the chaos.

I often think that probably it would be better if my parents got divorced. It would seem the best for all parties, but I don't know whether that would just mean trading one problem for another problem (perhaps). Family issues are super complex and I don't think there is a single answer to the problems, especially if the problems come from the parents. I can understand that there were some ideas around "get married when you are ready" or "get married when you are finished with your past".

In some cases, that idea is valid. However, in some other cases, perhaps that idea isn't valid. Imagine living in a toxic family where if you want to live separately (before getting married) is seen as a negative action. You are caught in a bind, basically. You keep getting showered by the poisons, yet you can't get yourself free. Even when you express your intent to get married, then somehow your parents will make it hard for you to leave. If your anger gets the best of you at one point, they will use it as a weapon to tell you that you are not ready to get married yet. So, here, you have 3 choices: stand still, get out, or get married.

Whichever choice you take, hopefully it will work for you and may your light always bless your heart.

My choice last year was to stand tall and put a "mask" in front of my mother, hoping that it wouldn't cause harm to my wedding plan. Eventually it broke me 3 weeks before my wedding day and I was quite lucky that I survived the whole ordeal. It could have gone the other way. However, it was a worthy sacrifice, for now, at the time of writing, I am living apart from my mother. That distance itself gives me a lot of moments of peace.

Even then, June this year, I had the intentions to not get vaccinated. I thought if I didn't get vaccinated, it would be easier for me to get COVID-19, so I wouldn't be tortured anymore by my mother and my oldest brother. Shortly after that, my wife knocked some sense to me and I realized that I was terribly wrong. Finally, I decided to get vaccinated in July.

## Second half of the year

The second half of the year was mostly better. There weren't a lot of family drama. My wife and I had two dose of vaccinations. However, I reached my limit in work, which leading to me [burning out](/blog/burning-out). Finally, I resigned.

It was surprisingly, I think, a correct decision from me. Just before I resigned, I didn't have any more energy left in my tank. Opening my work laptop was a pain, let alone opening an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). My creativity dried out. I was lucky that my financial was in a quite good shape when resigning, so I could catch my breath.

First few days were hard. I didn't really enjoy stuff as I did before. In this case, time really healed. Slowly, through my "funemployment", I recovered bit by bit.

I contributed to some fun projects, such as [password-ga](https://github.com/ans-4175/password-ga) and [random-gofood](https://github.com/ans-4175/random-gofood). At the same time, I also created stuff myself, for example, [count-up-down](https://github.com/imballinst/count-up-down), [how-long](https://github.com/imballinst/how-long), and reworked [this site](https://github.com/imballinst/peepohappy).

Hopefully, in 2022, I can get back on the journey. Wishing you all a great year ahead!
