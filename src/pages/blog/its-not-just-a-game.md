title: It's Not "Just a Game"
description: The reduction of "a game" to "just a game" may limit your perception from absorbing the key essence of the game itself.

_Hallo_! I hope you are doing well. In this post, let's talk about one sentence that people usually say, _"It's just a game!"_ How true is that? Let's discuss!

## Facets of a game

I experienced multiplayer games and single player games. The multiplayer games, some are competitive and some are not. If you ask me, back then when I was still playing competitively, it was definitely not "just a game", especially on tournaments where money was at stake. Ranked/ladder games were not as high stakes as tournaments, but as they say, falling is easier than climbing. The Matchmaking Rating (MMR) that I lost from losing/leaving a game is harder to regain.

As time went, I don't play competitive multiplayer games as often anymore and instead, I started playing single player games (or games where if I get punished, I get punished alone and not together with other teammates). It was really nice because there is less... guilty feeling for me, you know?

Or maybe I just don't like games where heavy communication is required anymore, which leaves the 3 games that I will share in this post: Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy X, and Expedition 33.

> But, but, but, Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG! How come it doesn't need heavy communication?

True, but the "multiplayer" aspect in FFXIV have different difficulties as well, ranging from casual, midcore, and hardcore. Of course, I took the casual one. I only subscribe for 1 month after a major patch, do the MSQ, some/most of the side stories, level up crafters/gatherers, and maybe revisit some other fighting jobs that haven't been leveled up to maximum. The casual content is, as written, very casual. I do not need to hyper focus, it's too tiring after a day of hard work. As such, no heavy communication is required.

Now, before we jump to how each game impacted me, I'll share a bit how I internalize the essence of a game. All of the games mentioned below are very heavy in terms of story. Each helped me in their own way and it's because, I think, I internalized the game's essence into myself. So, that's why, for those games, I don't want to say, _"It's just a game!"_

## Internalizing the essence of a game

Recalling myself before 2018, I don't think I cared as much as I do now for story-based games. I began caring for stories in 2018 because maybe, at that time, I began taking care of my mental state more (it was still subpar, but better than before where I was completely oblivious of it).

I remember the World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth expansion came up and there was a cutscene about Jaina and her mother, Katherine. I think that touched me... a lot. Katherine thought that Jaina was a traitor because she helped the Orcs assault Theramore, which ended up in her father, Daelin, killed in the aftermath. So, she sent Jaina into an "open prison" where people there get tortured mentally from their memories. At the end, Katherine realized the errors of her ways and helped the player save Jaina.

I was touched by that because I too, at that time, didn't have a good relationship with my mother. So, seeing other people, yes, even video game characters, get the warmth that I did not feel... it felt good. It didn't have to be me, I just had to be there so I can share in the warmth that I wasn't able to feel.

However, World of Warcraft is a mostly focused on battles. The story started going downwards, causing me to lose interest and stopped playing it. Until 2021, I tried to take a stab with FFXIV during the famous "World of Warcraft Exodus".

## My experiences

### Final Fantasy XIV

I wasn't a huge fan of Final Fantasy back then. I _think_ my only experience was Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, which was playable on Game Boy Advance (now I feel old). So, I didn't have much expectation playing the game. I just like, _"Why not? I don't have other games to play anyway."_

<!-- Parrot eating bisquit image -->

The point where I was sold was on A Realm Reborn, patch 2.55. I got super hooked from there. The idea to "kill off" most of the cast, leaving only few characters to venture into an unknown city with corrupt leaders... it was very something. I learned about relationship dynamics, which, I think helped me a bit in improving my interpersonal skills. I learned more about my emotions through journeying with the characters. Heavensward was a tales of faith.

> "For those we have lost. For those we can yet save."

Stormblood was OK. The theme of the expansion was about how people who spent a long time under other nation's rule may become "hopeless" and any plan to break free from the invader's grasp will just result in more pain. It's a dilemma.

The major patches though, were a huge step up. Fordola peered through the Warrior of Light's memory and beheld countless traumas and betrayals. Nanamo letting go Raubahn to take part in the rebuilding of Ala Mhigo. Finally, Tsukoyomi wrapping up the Stormblood expansion with a fantastic trial mechanics and musics. Stormblood was a tales of fire.

> "Smile for me, Raubahn. I would have this parting be a joyous one."

Shadowbringers was PEAK. A new world with new people. The "Welcome to Shadowbringers" moment. The Thancred/Ryne dynamics. The Blessing of Light was used as a "powerbank" to store all the light surrounding Norvrandt, which, eventually exceeded the capacity and hurt the Warrior of Light's character. The villains, who previously I thought were just "plain villains" who should be eliminated, dropped lore bombs which exposed their "human" side. Even after defeating the 5.0 expansion boss, I thought to myself, _"Am I doing the right thing?"_

The major patches were on par with the base expansion. How the Warrior of Light's comrades were living on a borrowed time and had to find a way to return back to the original world, how events unfolded in the original world with Estinien and Gaius, and lastly... how Elidibus, so fixated in his duty, forgot who he swore his oath with. Shadowbringers was a tales of loss.

> "Yours is a long road, my friend, and it stretches on to places beyond imagining.
> With your every step, these grand adventures shall grow more distant and faint.
> And there may come a day when you forget the faces and voices of those you have met along the way.
> On that day, I bid you remember this...
> That no matter how far your journey may take you, you stand where you stand by virtue of the road you walked to get there.
> For in times of hardship, when you fear you cannot go on...
> The joy you have known, the pain you have felt, the prayers you have whispered and answered—they shall ever be your strength and your comfort.
> This I hope—I believe, here at memory's end."

Finally, Endwalker. An expansion where despair turns people into beasts. It was very fitting because at the time Endwalker dropped, I was probably at one of the lowest points in my life, if not the lowest. I didn't have the desire to do software engineering stuff, so I just woke up, turned on my computer, then doing everything in a very... "autopilot" moment. The previous expansions helped me "feel" until Endwalker launched.

From there, every time I felt despair, every time I was about to feel panic attack, I recalled the Endwalker expansion. How Quintus forfeited his life, how the Warrior of Light stood against all odds to prevent Zenos wreaking havoc with their body, how the brave Matsya shielded Mehvan's baby at death's door, the honest conversation between the Warrior of Light and Hermes... there were too much moment that I really cherish from Endwalker. If I have to pick a few, it would be the moment Urianger meeting Moenbryda's parents and when Fourchenault opened up to Alisaie and Alphinaud. As mentioned above, I'm a sucker for heartwarming parent stories.

Elpis was something else. The moments with Venat were great, especially when she asked _"Have your journey been good? Have it been worthwhile?"_ It definitely has been, at that time. At least, in that virtual world. Venat had this "motherly" energy that, again, I was a bit weak to. So, when presented with her journey during the Final Days and up until the present moment, I felt as if I swam in a sea of onions.

<!-- Meteion dropping to her knees video -->

Oh, and I definitely do not forget about Meteion dropping to her knees when recalling Hermes' words at the edge of existence. It's such a tragic story, a parent-figure who did not want their child-figure not to suffer, but it ended up hurting them since they were not prepared for the outside world. I'm not saying that parents should give their children "tough love". I think there should be a good balance between control and grace, so we can prevent the extreme ends.

> "Meteion. Though I gave you wings to soar the heavens. I did not teach you how to walk the earth. So loath was I to bind another living being. In the course of your long journey, you will learn from those you meet. Learn to walk, run, and so much more. A flower. Yes, upon your return, I will gift you a beautiful flower."

At the end of the day, FFXIV gave me a lot of... what to say, "experience"? Especially about regulating emotions. Whenever I'm feeling not grounded, I just recalled the scene where G'raha helped a civilan to stay calm, take deep breaths, so they were not transformed into a beast. It was amazing.

### Final Fantasy X

I remember I played FFX in the Ramadan 2023. I remember I played it after taraweeh prayer. I finished it before Ramadan ended. Probably you can say it was a wasted time, especially since I played it in holy month, I don't disagree. However, Final Fantasy X helped me another important learning for me about parent-child relationship, which, I think can't just be taught from preaching and whatnots.

Since Tidus was a child, he hated his father, Jecht, because his father was a famous blitzball player. Blitzball is like an underwater football game, something like in water polo perhaps, but in this one, players are all fully submerged. Don't ask me how they breathe. It is said that blitzball players can hold their breath for a long time, so, yeah. Additionally, from Tidus' perspective, Jecht often bullied him, saying things like "You are only good at crying", including always spending time together with his mother, leaving Tidus all alone.

However, as the game progressed, Tidus found a lot of Jecht spheres. One of them is in the Macalania Woods, after beating the water boss Spherimorph. In the sphere recording, Jecht let his "mask" slip a bit and tried to lift Tidus' spirit. He also mentioned that he is not good at "these things", which usually means he's a parent who gives "tough love", hence it is hard to express "soft love".

<!-- Jecht sphere in Macalania -->

In the Farplane, after Yuna asked Tidus to remember Jecht, Tidus remembered his mother instead, which made the pyreflies present her image in front of them. It was at this moment, Tidus realized that it wasn't that his father pulled his mother away from him, but rather his mother was the one who is too attached to his father. Jecht even suggested to his wife, _"Ah, go to him. He'll cry if you don't."_

In Zanarkand Ruins, Tidus saw the pyreflies "recording" of Braska, Jecht, and Auron running towards the last cloister of trials. He saw how Jecht, who in his head was a rather "selfish" person, cared about Braska by asking him to stop the pilgrimage, so he didn't have to die [from the Final Summoning].

Before fighting Yunalesca, Jecht said that his dream was actually his son, back in Zanarkand. Since there was no way back home for him, he decided to become fayth for Braska instead, which, Auron also opposed. After fighting Yunalesca, Auron told Tidus using pyrefiles that Jecht asked Auron to take care of Tidus in Zanarkand, because he would like someone to be a "father-figure" for him. Auron was probably clueless how to act for that role, though, so, yeah, he ended up just being a "guardian" for Tidus instead, especially when Sin attacked dream Zanarkand.

Finally, when facing his father inside Sin, Tidus "hate" for his father began to falter. He tried to reach out his father as he got dragged down below the arena and transformed into Braska's Final Aeon. After he defeated Jecht, he finally let go of his hate and proud of his father... something that he had never said before.

<!-- Ending cinematic -->

Yes, yes, there were a lot of sad moments too apart of the parent-child moments. The laughing scene (especially after finishing the game), the summoner's objective revelation in Home, the destruction of Home, Yuna's goodbyte sphere, Auron's sending, and of course... the damn ending cinematic. It got me good. It did feel different after I spent considerable amount of time together with the party. Yuna's headshake, the failed hug, and finally the acceptance hug.

> "The people and the friends that we have lost, or the dreams that have faded... Never forget them."

### Expedition 33

<!-- Expedition 33 image -->

Just last week I finished Expedition 33. It was so good, it was probably my second story-based game with M rating (after Detroit: Become Human). If I wrote about it, this post would have been too long. So, yeah, I'll just write a dedicated post about it. Stay tuned!

## Closing words

So, yeah, for me, games have a massive impact on my personal development, especially the story-based ones. It helped me process the traumas from my past and helped me learn about interpersonal relationships. So, it's definitely not "just a game". For me, anyway. How about you?
