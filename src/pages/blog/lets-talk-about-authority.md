Hey, how is it going? Time surely flew, blink and you will miss majority of 2025. Hopefully, you are in a good condition for all body, mind, and soul. So, what are we going to talk about in this post? I'm going to talk about authority. Let's get started!

## What is authority?

According to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/authority), the definition of authority is as follows.

> 1a: power to influence or command thought, opinion, or behavior 
> 1b: freedom granted by one in authority

So, someone who has a higher hierarchy than us technically has higher authority than us: parent-children, manager-direct reports, teacher-students, and so on, and so forth. On the other hand, sometimes authority isn't determined by hierarchy, access control is the case. The Human Resources (HR) department of an organization _technically_ is on the same level of department as many other functions, but they have the authority to access the company's employee records, which most of the time not accessible by most employees.

Higher authority _usually_ translates to higher power... which leads us to the next section: _"What can you do with that power?"_

## Utilizing authority

When someone is given an authority, there are 3 options that may happen. They can either become a dictator, leader, or nobody. But how?

### Dictator

> "I have higher authority than you."
> "I am always right."
> "If you oppose me, you will regret it."
> "That is not right because I do not like it."

They say absolute power corrupts absolutely, I think it is a very relevant saying nowadays. We see people with power do anything they like without consequences, because they have been granted authorization to do so. The one condition that allows this to happen is a broken moral compass. If someone with a functional moral compass is given an authority to do something bad, they will think twice or even thrice before committing it. Not so much with those with broken moral compass though, as long as they stand to gain, they will dare to see other people suffer.

Unfortunately, this is what's currently happening in Indonesia right now. While we are at it, please keep the people of Sumatra in your prayers because they really need it right now. Not only they are suffering from flash floods, they also have to [face repressions from Indonesian military units](https://x.com/indepenSumatera/status/2004219388803915845). As mentioned above, the oppressors likely have been granted authority by their higher-ups to do what they are doing and unfortunately, their moral compass is broken, so they do not even think about opposing the order.

### Leader

Right, let's stop talking about dictatorship because it is honestly depressing. Let's talk about what a real leader should do (which, I am also currently still learning).

> "Here are the list of things that we can do. What do you think?"
> "I think the current approach is good, but how about the alternative?"
> "I'd like you to work on this initiative because I think you have the capability to do it."
> "The current approach is not advisable because it is not only not secure, but it is also not optimal. Here are the references."

If a dictator gives other people authority for their benefit, a leader gives other people authority for everyone's benefit. A dictator will rarely want their pawns to be smarter than them, whereas a leader will be happy when a teammate surpasses theirs in terms of capacity.

Trust is key when giving authority as a leader. I think you can't just give the same level of authorization to everyone to do anything--everything has to be thought about, even for a bit. Sometimes, authorizing someone who doesn't have the capacity to do the thing is the same as throwing someone to lion's cage. It doesn't only urt them, but it also hurts our credibility. This is probably one of the dilemmas that often happen in real world.

Leaders communication approach is more towards discussion. As long as the data supports it and it makes sense in the current context, then it doesn't matter who wins the argument as long as everyone gets the benefit.

I like to think that the term "leader" is only translated as someone who has higher hierarchy. I don't think so. Anyone can actually be a leader if they utilize their authority well. In other words, a "leader" doesn't have to be a manager, director, or whatever titles above it. You can be a leader by simply taking charge of something. If that something is not clear, what can you do to make it clear? If you can navigate through those difficulties, I believe you have the qualities to become a leader already.

### Nobody

Now, the last one. You might be thinking, _"How can someone with authority be a nobody?"_ Well, the answer is simple: they just don't have the drive (yet) or maybe their drive is gone, which, maybe not really their fault (especially for the latter).

I often heard from football-related discussions that "captains don't hide in a match". I think the same too in real world. If you often find yourselves "hiding" when facing difficulties or challenges, especially when you have the authority, I'm afraid you'd have to do better than that. "Hiding" in this case can mean being overly reliant on others or not taking full accountability of yourself.

As long as we "hide", we prevent ourselves from "showing up", which means less chance for our work to be recognized. But yeah, of course it's case-by-case because not everything is within our control, but you get the point.

## Closing words

That's all for this post--the last one for the year. I hope next year will be better for us all. Thank you for reading!
