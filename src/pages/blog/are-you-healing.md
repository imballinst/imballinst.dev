If you broke a machine and you tried to fix it, but you only made it worse, does it still count as fixing?

Nowadays, since mental health has become something more common, the word "healing" also appears more often. Sometimes companies might just use it to "lure" customers because... who doesn't want to heal? Hence, I come up with the question, _"are you healing?"_

From what I could perceive, "healing" is sometimes used in the place of "coping". As I understand it, healing is an action with the intent to close out a wound or an injury. Depending on the type of wound or injury, some may fully recover, and some others unfortunately may only be able to partially recover. Coping, on the other hand, is an action that makes your wound to be less destructive compared to if it is kept as it is. In other words: damage control.
