I had a question before I got married, _"Will emotional affection between husband and wife last forever during their lifetime?"_. Tony Stark once said, ["I guess we'll find out"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/characters/nm0000375).

_DISCLAIMER: [@matahatigraphy](https://www.instagram.com/matahatigraphy/?hl=en) was our wedding photographer. They gave us the raw pictures and the edited pictures, but for this post, I can't find the edited ones that I wanted. Therefore, I took out the raw ones and tweaked them myself. If you have a keen eye for photography stuff, I'm sorry if the following pictures hurt your eyes!_

## What relationship is about?

For me, a relationship is all about trust, patience, and empathy. I didn't know about that before -- I had to learn them the hard way. It sounds like an excuse, but I didn't really learn a lot about emotional intelligence in my family -- it simply didn't exist (and probably still doesn't). Anger was forbidden, sadness was forbidden, just keep up a mask of a happy face all day to prevent further problems.

Moreover, since the "culprit" in my parents' _house_ was a woman, it was really hard for me to fully open up to the opposing gender, as I was afraid of getting a person with her traits. Love was a topic that I would tread really, really carefully. Yes, I had crushes, but I kept questioning myself, "Is this love? Or is this lust?". I think I was being paranoid, while at the same time, I wanted someone who could match my puzzle piece. I was conflicting with my inner self most of the time.

Fast forward to May 2016, I got the internship that enabled me to do my thesis defense in September. Little did I know, the woman that I would fall in love with also worked in that company. It all started when I accepted the part-time offer after finishing my internship there -- I thought it was a great chance to improve my "actual real job skills" because I was mostly investing myself in my gaming career.

My wife -- her name is Hawa -- she used to drive her own car to the office. At one point, since I didn't live too far from her house, I wanted to join her on a ride back together, so she could drop me somewhere on her way home. The first ride was not intentional, but soon, it became a habit. I was lucky that she didn't mind.

We started going to the office together as well, where she would pick me up from "my pickup point". During the ride, we talked with each other -- from casual topics to more personal ones. I got to know her as a person instead of just a colleague. We discovered each other's vulnerable selves. My mind began to question, "Is this the one?"

However, my paranoid self said, "Hahahaha. No. She is just like _that_ woman, why did you even think about it?".

So, yes. My paranoid self won again. Shortly after I graduated, I went to a conference called [ICoDSE 2016](https://eventegg.com/icodse-2016/). There were a lot of my friends who got into that conference as well, hence it was a great time. We went to souvenir shops, where I bought a pair of sandals as a gift for Hawa. To this day, I didn't know why I had that idea.

I arrived back in Bandung and took a day off (if I remember correctly). The next day, I gave Hawa the sandals. I must say, for a person who had such paranoid opening up to the opposing gender, I never saw such happiness in one's face when receiving a gift from me. I think that was the moment where my "paranoid castle" began to crumble, and so it did.

After that, it was a slow-but-sure ride. We got closer and closer until we were "officially" together in March 2017. I thought slow buildup to the relationship would mean that we understood each other. I couldn't be more wrong. That was the moment where I began to learn 3 important things in life: **trust**, **patience**, and **empathy**.

### Learning the hard way

#### Patience and Empathy

When I just started being together with Hawa, one of the words that would describe me most was **rigid**. Everything was binary in my eyes. It was either **true** or **false**, there was no between. Because of that, we had some good "fights". However, we always made up after each one. We resolved them and made action plans on what to do should similar problems occur in the future.

With that said, there were kinds of stuff that we couldn't change overnight. We could change it, but we needed to be patient with each other. We needed to understand the other person that it wasn't easy to change. Hence, we learned **patience** and **empathy** together.

My life, which was monochrome, was beginning to have colors because of her.

#### Trust

Then, it was about **trust**. Thankfully, we didn't have to go through fights to learn about this. We just trusted each other when we had to maintain Long Distance Relationship (LDR), as I was about to pursue my Masters at the University of Melbourne, while Hawa was about to pursue hers at Institut Teknologi Bandung.

We scheduled a weekly video call, which was a bit tricky with Melbourne being 3-4 hours ahead of Bandung. There were times that I or she was busy and couldn't make it, so in that case, we scheduled the video call at a different time. Although we only did that once a week, we always kept a tab of each other every day with text chat. We made sure to respect each other's boundaries because we both knew that each of us had a lot of stuff to do in our everyday life.

In March 2019, I had a chance to go to San Francisco. It was tough for both me and Hawa because we had never experienced 14 hours of time difference before, despite the fact that it was only for ~8-9 days. My daytime was her nighttime, and vice versa. Although we could still text each other, we couldn't do our usual weekly video call schedule, because my times and her times didn't match. To make things worse, I also bought a SIM Card that wasn't compatible with my phone. Therefore, 2G was all that I had and I needed to rely on a Wi-Fi connection.

Every day, we tried to find good and matching times for both of us with no luck. However, a few days before I flew back to Melbourne, I was free in the morning with a Wi-Fi connection (yay!). That was also the time she could have a video call with me, and so we did. All in all, it was a good experience for both of us.

### Pre-wedding struggles

People said that one of the hardest struggles came before the wedding event. Well, they aren't wrong. There were times where I would be emotionally broken, but Hawa was always there for me. She trusted me, even when I didn't trust myself. She was the light that [gently gave me the strength to move forward](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/ONE_(Japanese_song)>). She was/is a strong woman, and I am the luckiest man alive to have married her.

### Emotional affection and the three aspects

For me, emotional affection is something that is invisible, but I can _feel_ it. It feels _warm_. It feels _gentle_. It feels _nurturing_. The 3 aspects above, **trust**, **patience**, and **empathy** -- they are probably the most important kind of affections that made us love each other. When you are trusted, you feel good. When the other person is being patient with you, you feel good. When the other person empathizes with you, you feel good.

When these 3 components exist together in a household, I believe only a harmonious family will flourish.

## Curiosities

![Duration timer since the second I got married to Hawa: https://imballinst.github.io/married/.](images/how-long-married.png)

At the time of writing, it was around 1 month and 11 days since I got married to Hawa. The GIF above was made from [a website that I made specifically to count how long has it been since our wedding](https://imballinst.github.io/married). Although I know "monthiversary" is not a thing, I thought it was cool seeing all the numbers change together at the same time. Now, I kind of understand why anniversaries are a big deal for some people. It is a _life milestone_.

Now, let's get back to the beginning of this post: _"Will emotional affection between husband and wife last forever during their lifetime?"_. Well, that website is also made for that. For me and my wife, I really want to prove that the answer is **yes**. I want to keep trusting her, I want to keep being patient with her, and I want to always empathize with her. Hopefully, only death will sever our emotional affection -- so the duration on that website will keep ticking.

For the closing words, I would like to ask myself and my wife, _"When we are old, will we still see each other as we did in this picture?"_. Again, I really want to prove that the answer is **yes**. The road will be rocky, our emotional affection towards each other may be tested, but I think the outcome is indescribable if we stay strong.

I have mentioned about harmonious family earlier in this post. That is the outcome. That is our goal. A happy family where happiness spreads to all family members.
