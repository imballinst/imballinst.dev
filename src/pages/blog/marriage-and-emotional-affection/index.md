I had a question before I got married, "Will emotional affection last forever? Will a husband and a wife's chemistry deplete over time?". Tony Stark once said, "I guess we'll find out".

<Putting the ring image>

- Prologue, talk about relationship and wedding
- Talk about how wedding isn't the end, but rather it's just the beginning
- Talk about the differences between the life before marriage and life after marriage

<Timer GIF>

- Talk about how long it's been since I've been married
- Shameless self-promotion on https://imballinst.github.io/married
- Talk about the background of the counter, mention about affection, which we will cover in the next section
- Tease a bit about upcoming post regarding the thought-process behind creating it. Ask questions! Ask the reader how they'd implement it and mention me in Twitter.

- Talk about affection and happiness in that image
- Throw back to the title of this post
- Remember what Mas Didit said, regarding "it's up and down -- just like faith. Sometimes it's down, but then it'll bounce back."

At the time of writing, I don't have the answer to my own question yet. But, I really hope the answer is **yes**, and I will try to make that happen.

- REMEMBER:
  -- Be careful with words. It's kinda a sensitive topic. Make sure I'm being specific and not being general. Try to always use "me" instead of "you", or "we", or "us".
