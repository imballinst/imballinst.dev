I was first introduced to games by my brother when I was around 8 years old -- they were old Windows games, such as Solitaire, Hearts, Chips's Challenge, Rodent's Revenge, and Pinball. Later on, I also learned about other "popular" PC games, such as Need for Speed, Red Alert 2, Counter-Strike, and Warcraft III. Since we only had 1 PC at that time, we needed to take turn to play games, although most of the time, it was my brother playing and I only watched. However, sometimes we did naughty things, such as using my mother's unused laptop (which she left at home) to play LAN games together. That was before we discovered internet cafe.

## Competing Against "Real" People

One day, I think at that time I was around 12 years old, my brother invited me to join him playing in an internet cafe. We played some Counter-Strike games, as well as Red Alert 2 with other people there on LAN. I think that was the first time I actually faced "actual people" instead of Artificial Intelligence (will be shortened to **AI** later on), and I remember I was utterly destroyed by them. Anyways, my brother blamed me for the loss, though it did not last long. I think it showed how much he wanted to win at times.

Anyway, we got home, and I think we got scolded by our parents because they thought my brother introduced bad things to me, since internet cafe did not necessarily have the best reputation amongst the elder during my childhood. So, there's that. I didn't play in internet cafe anymore until I was in Junior High School. I only played with my brother and my family happened to have quite a fortune, so my father could afford me a laptop and we could play together at home instead of in internet cafe. Probably, that was an effort to prevent me learning bad things from people out there.

The internet cafe near my Junior High School was probably the most influential thing that had happened to me back then. It was not the school, it was the internet cafe itself. Around one month since the school started, some of my friends asked me to play Counter-Strike in the internet cafe. Its name was **Traktor.net**, people called it "TW" for some reason -- probably because "internet cafe" was "warnet" in Indonesian and "TW" was an acronym for "Traktor Warnet". So, there's that. I enjoyed my relationship with 8th and 9th grade seniors. It was very unlike my seniors at my previous elementary school. We had a lot of fun. I think I was quite good when it came to game at that time, though I was nowhere near professional-level players, of course.

Some months later, I discovered Battle-Net and Indogamers when I was playing Warcraft III custom map, Defense of the Ancients (shortened to **DotA** later on), mostly my seniors had the accounts to play there, but I didn't because I didn't know about that before. Long story short, I tried creating various account names in "Indogamers Junior" server with no luck. These names weren't available. I got desperate and I just typed "illllll" for no reason. That's right, 1 lowercase "I" and 6 lowercase "L". Then, boom. My account was created, magically.

Truth be told, I did not have many friends at school, because I was not really a "social" person. However, I befriended some good people through Battle-Net. We are still friends until now, although I don't really communicate with them as much as I did when we were still competing in tournaments (we will get to that in later sections). I got invited to their clan and one day we decided to meet up. It was fun... and amazing, perhaps. I did not know that internet friends could be real friends.

I think I was quite edgy back then when it came to winning games. I often "raged" in chat, like typing with caps lock on, calling out names, and all that. A friend told me that if I kept going like that, then no one would want to play with me anymore. Yeah, I was quite infamous for that attitude. When I tried applying to be an operator in that private server (operators were like people who volunteered to help moderate the server), one of the questions asked to me was, "If you are currently losing in a game, then someone whispers to you to report a case, what will you do? Will you flame (mock) them?". That was good.

However, my "edgy" status did not end there. There were other stuff than losing that made me mad, two of them were: (1) laggy internet and (2) sudden family activities.

Back then, Facebook was quite a thing after Friendster. People started to use it, upload photos, videos, and other stuff. Somehow, when someone opened a photo album, my internet speed drastically dropped. Sometimes, I got disconnected. Back then, in Warcraft III, when you were disconnected, you were done. There were no ways to join the game back. On top of that, since it was on a private server, people might accuse you for intentionally leaving the game, which could end in my account getting banned. This made me determinated to not create a Facebook account.

As for sudden family activities, I was perplexed by my family's communication. There were times that my parents would ask us to go out all of a sudden. It was as if I could not control my own life, because there were always stuff that could interrupt my time. What is parents' relationship with their children anyways? My life was like full of secrets and I should play guessing games, _"Oh hey, this works now. But, I don't know whether it will work again later because I don't have the information whatsoever"_. As for this, I have implemented a family calendar with regards to activities that we (I and my wife) need to do together, so we are always informed on what we are up to. This ensures that we can decide the best timings for each of our own's _me-time_.

It changed when I started my college, where I needed to move to Bandung from Jakarta. I gained control over my life -- this included waking up, eating, taking a bath, sleeping, studying, and all that. Since I was on my own and I subscribed for a personal internet connection (I didn't share with the others in my dorm), it was also easier because I knew where to complain if there was a performance downgrade on my connection. I did not need to communicate with the others, which means less friction. Yay!

It was also during my college, I started to pursue competitive gaming more seriously with my internet friends. I was not a bright student or academician at that time, so this was a huge risk. Sometimes, I felt like I was just being a passenger in my group project, because I couldn't really manage my time better. I was too fixated in becoming a good DotA 2 player. It was even worse because I decided to also took part in some organizational activities. That was probably the nail in the coffin and I had to kiss my 24 hours a day goodbye.

My team did not have that kind of luck (as in getting top 3 in a competition) during our first 1-2 years, not even in small local tournaments. Our biggest achievement during that time was probably when we beat [KoaLa](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/KoaLa) who happened to be a stand-in of a team who faced us in the final qualifier round.

But, in the group stage, we didn't stand any chance either amidst the teams such as Zero Latitude.

We started joining a lot more tournaments/leagues, in particular joinDOTA's Asia League. I think it was one of the best experiences in doing competitive DotA 2 for me. We started from Indonesia league (which was until Division 3), then we climbed up, up, and away until we reached the qualifier round for Division 2. When we qualified for Division 2, I was really happy because Division 2 was where all the teams across the Southeast Asia. Finally, I could represent something for my country in something I was passionate at.

However, we hit another boulder. We got stuck on Division 2 and sometimes we dropped down to Division 3, back and forth. We had some of our great moments, but it was not enough to even bring us to the qualifier for Division 1.

While we were playing on Division 2 of joinDOTA League, we won some of the local tournaments as well. It was not much, the prize for first place was 1.5 million IDR, which was around US$110. The tournament itself usually was held for 2-3 days during the weekend, so it was around US$35 per day, per team, for winning first place.

That was mostly it -- we competed in bigger Indonesian tournaments, but since we were mostly students and did not dedicate 100% of our times to "train", we were clearly behind compared with other top-tier teams from Indonesia.

I have regrets over those times. I overvalued grinding and I forgot the value of watching and learning. Yes, applying what we have learned is important, but as much as putting them into practice is important, we can also get insights by watching how other players play and do their stuff. Perhaps, if I "studied" other top-tier players inside and outside Indonesia, I could have become a better player.

## Turning Points

The year was 2016. I needed to apply to another internship in order to do my thesis defense because I procrastinated from working on my previous internship report. This caused my university internship supervisor was "mad" at me and I thought there was no second chance. So, I expected another 1-2 months of suffering. Everything I would do to graduate that year.

I was so wrong when I expected my path on competitive gaming would still be the same before, during, and after the internship.

Truth be told, I knew almost nothing when I first applied for the internship at [eFishery](https://www.efishery.com). My portfolio only consisted of two small sites that I worked on, [a JavaScript-based clock that changes background based on timezones](https://github.com/imballinst/javascript-timezone) and [RIP THE DREAM's static page](imballinst.github.io/rtdota2/). But, for some reason, the company accepted my application. That was the first good thing.

I found a really good mentor in the company. He guided me in a way so that, I could pave my way to understand and catch-up to the newer world of web development. Slowly, I began comparing this "front-end engineer" job prospect and competitive gamer. By the end of the internship, I was offered a part-time opportunity and I took it.

This job was unlike competing in tournamnets, I thought. It was chill, urgent at times, but my stress-level was not as high as when I was inside a tournament game. Also, better "salary"? Sign me up. I decided to stop doing tournaments, though sadly that also stopped my team from competing further. However, I was still playing DotA 2, in particular for Battle Cups (prior to The International event), as well as World of Warcraft for its Arena PvP.

As for now, I don't play both games anymore. I only play Hearthstone during my spare time for fun and that's it, though I still follow a bit of DotA 2 and World of Warcraft from Twitch streams and/or tournaments out there. No matter how different my current job with what I did in the past, I still have a soft spot for video games.

## Prospects in Esports

Let's talk about prospects. For DotA 2 prize pool alone, [it is quite big](https://dota2.prizetrac.kr/) for a team game. In fact, The International 2019, as of July 2020, [is still the tournament with the highest prize pool](https://www.statista.com/statistics/517940/leading-esports-tournamets-worldwide-by-prize-pool/). Of course, there are also other games with big prize pools as well, such as Fortnite and League of Legends.

However, most of these tournaments only come yearly. It is one shot to get the big prize. If you don't win, you don't get paid (unless your team pays you as a player). If you or your team have immense amount of talent and dedication, I think you should give it a shot. However, in esports, you also need to be lucky, just as how professional athletes in sports do.

Sure, if we take a look at [some of the top football players' earnings](https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/the-14-best-paid-footballers-in-the-world-2020), we will think that, _"Oh, it's going to be so nice to be a football player!"_. But, the road to become one of them is definitely not as easy as it looks. First, you will need to be dedicated. Then, you will need to "ramp up" in local football teams, then you hope to be noticed by leagues outside of your country. If you plan to become a Premier League player, you probably would need to play in less-competitive Europe leagues first. You need to be consistent, you need to be free from injuries, which sometimes, are career-defining for a lot of football players.

Whether you are going for sports or esports, you will need to dedicate your life for it. Sometimes, it will require sacrifice. You can't get the best of all worlds when you are chasing or doing your dreams.

In esports, other than winning tournaments, a player can also try to stream their gameplay. Streaming is another tricky topic. Not all famous players can gather crowd to watch their gameplay. It requires social skills and consistency [to stream on schedule]. However, if you success in both aspects, you will have your own community who will subscribe or even donate to you for making their day.

One thing for sure, I don't think esports at the moment is as stable as real sports especially during these pandemic times. A team recently [released all of their players](https://twitter.com/TeamGeekFam/status/1303649355736346624). Also, usually Valve held DotA 2 major on-site tournaments in a year. However, due to this COVID-19 situation, there are only online tournaments and their prize pool are not as big as official Valve DotA 2 major tournaments.

## Now, I am...

The year is 2020. Currently, I am working as a front-end engineer for [Tetrate.io](https://www.tetrate.io/) and I think I am quite happy with it. I have flexible working hours, I am getting experience working with people around the globe, I am getting good amount of money, and again, my stress level is not as high as when I am competing in a tournament.

One day, I hope esports will become on-par with real sports. I hope families and society will adapt to this industry and accept that playing games can be a career. Now, my dream is not to become a professional gamer anymore. I dream to build a healthy family -- physically and emotionally.
