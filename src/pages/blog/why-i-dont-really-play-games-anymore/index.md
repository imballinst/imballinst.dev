I was first introduced to games by my brother when I was around 8 years old -- they were old Windows games, such as Solitaire, Hearts, Chips's Challenge, Rodent's Revenge, and Pinball. Later on, I also learned about other "popular" PC games, such as Need for Speed, Red Alert 2, Counter-Strike, and Warcraft III. Since we only had 1 PC at that time, we needed to take turn to play games, although most of the time, it was my brother playing and I only watched. However, sometimes we did naughty things, such as using my mother's unused laptop (which she left at home) to play LAN games together. That was before we discovered internet cafe.

One day, I think at that time I was around 12 years old, my brother invited me to join him playing in an internet cafe. We played some Counter-Strike games, as well as Red Alert 2 with other people there on LAN. I think that was the first time I actually faced "actual people" instead of Artificial Intelligence (will be shortened to **AI** later on), and I remember I was utterly destroyed by them. Anyways, my brother blamed me for the loss, though it did not last long. I think it showed how much he wanted to win at times.

Anyway, we got home, and I think we got scolded by our parents because they thought my brother introduced bad things to me, since internet cafe did not necessarily have the best reputation amongst the elder during my childhood. So, there's that. I didn't play in internet cafe anymore until I was in Junior High School. I only played with my brother and my family happened to have quite a fortune, so my father could afford me a laptop and we could play together at home instead of in internet cafe. Probably, that was an effort to prevent me learning bad things from people out there.

The internet cafe near my Junior High School was probably the most influential thing that had happened to me back then. It was not the school, it was the internet cafe itself. Around one month since the school started, some of my friends asked me to play Counter-Strike in the internet cafe. Its name was **Traktor.net**, people called it "TW" for some reason -- probably because "internet cafe" was "warnet" in Indonesian and "TW" was an acronym for "Traktor Warnet". So, there's that. I enjoyed my relationship with 8th and 9th grade seniors. It was very unlike my seniors at my previous elementary school. We had a lot of fun. I think I was quite good when it came to game at that time, though I was nowhere near professional-level players, of course.

Some months later, I discovered Battle-Net and Indogamers when I was playing Warcraft III custom map, Defense of the Ancients (shortened to **DotA** later on), mostly my seniors had the accounts to play there, but I didn't because I didn't know about that before. Long story short, I tried creating various account names in "Indogamers Junior" server with no luck. These names weren't available. I got desperate and I just typed "illllll" for no reason. That's right, 1 lowercase "I" and 6 lowercase "L". Then, boom. My account was created, magically.

Truth be told, I did not have many friends at school, because I was not really a "social" person. However, I befriended some good people through Battle-Net. We are still friends until now, although I don't really communicate with them as much as I did when we were still competing in tournaments (we will get to that in later sections). I got invited to their clan and one day we decided to meet up. It was fun... and amazing, perhaps. I did not know that internet friends could be real friends.

I think I was quite edgy back then when it came to winning games. I often "raged" in chat, like typing with caps lock on, calling out names, and all that. A friend told me that if I kept going like that, then no one would want to play with me anymore. Yeah, I was quite infamous for that attitude. When I tried applying to be an operator in that private server (operators were like people who volunteered to help moderate the server), one of the questions asked to me was, "If you are currently losing in a game, then someone whispers to you to report a case, what will you do? Will you flame (mock) them?". That was good.

However, my "edgy" status did not end there. There were other stuff than losing that made me mad, two of them were: (1) laggy internet and (2) sudden family activities.

Back then, Facebook was quite a thing after Friendster. People started to use it, upload photos, videos, and other stuff. Somehow, when someone opened a photo album, my internet speed drastically dropped. Sometimes, I got disconnected. Back then, in Warcraft III, when you were disconnected, you were done. There were no ways to join the game back. On top of that, since it was on a private server, people might accuse you for intentionally leaving the game, which could end in my account getting banned. This made me determinated to not create a Facebook account.

As for sudden family activities, I was perplexed by my family's communication. There were times that my parents would ask us to go out all of a sudden. It was as if I could not control my own life, because there were always stuff that could interrupt my time. What is parents' relationship with their children anyways? My life was like full of secrets and I should play guessing games, _"Oh hey, this works now. But, I don't know whether it will work again later because I don't have the information whatsoever"_. As for this, I have implemented a family calendar with regards to activities that we (I and my wife) need to do together, so we are always informed on what we are up to. This ensures that we can decide the best timings for each of our own's _me-time_.

Key points:

- How I became a gamer in the first place
- CS + DotA against AI, then against actual people
- There was a burning determination to be the best inside me in terms of playing games that I like
- Things that block my path -- e.g. laggy internet, interruptions from family
- College life -- where I had quite control of my own life, but as well as my gaming path made me quite a burden in group projects
- Winning some prizes from online tournaments which were not much, had flashes during a local tournament and jDL Asia (image of getting 3rd in GV, video vs RvL, and video in jDL as Dark Seer)
- Regrets -- I overvalued grinding, instead of doing it smartly. Watching+applying is more effective than just blindly trying to apply things over and over.

- Final project, internships, and downfall from competitive gaming
- Stopped joining tournaments, but still sometimes participated in Battle Cups, and doing ladder in World of Warcraft arena, etc.
- Around February/March, stopped playing Dota 2 and subscribing to World of Warcraft. Played games merely just for fun, like StarCraft II and Hearthstone
- Did not play an "actual game" since last month, because I do not have the time and drive anymore
- Casual games such as TypeRacer is always welcome

- Prize pool is big https://dota2.prizetrac.kr/, but need consistency througout the season. One moment of lapse will cost your team the tournament.
- Valve's official Dota 2 Major usually happens every 3 months. The prize pool for first place is 1M USD. Divide that with the team + org, each person probably gets $100k-$200k.
- For the last place, however, they only get US$62k. That's around $6k-10k with the same equation. So, US\$2k-3k per month, which is still good.

- However, "Getting lucky" in esports is as important as "getting lucky" in real sports.
- It's hard to be noticed by tier 2/3 team, let alone break through to tier 1 team, which usually are the prime contenders of the major.
- A person should be dedicating their life and time to the game. There's a lot to sacrifice.
- Other than winning tournaments, people can stream. But streaming is another tricky topic, because not all people can "gather" crowd and keep them interested. Also, it's not a guarantee whether non-tier 1 teams "pay" their players.
- esports is not as stable as real sports especially in these pandemic times. A team recently released all of their players (https://twitter.com/TeamGeekFam/status/1303649355736346624).

- a new life as a software engineer.
- how being software engineer could be "relaxing" at times, although there were some close calls, as well.
- creating work and life balance in marriage life.
