description: I was still a competitive gamer back in 2016. Then, I slowly walked away from it.

Key points:

- How I became a gamer in the first place
- CS + DotA against AI, then against actual people
- There was a burning determination to be the best inside me in terms of playing games that I like
- Things that block my path -- e.g. laggy internet, interruptions from family
- College life -- where I had quite control of my own life, but as well as my gaming path made me quite a burden in group projects
- Winning some prizes from online tournaments which were not much, had flashes during a local tournament and jDL Asia (image of getting 3rd in GV, video vs RvL, and video in jDL as Dark Seer)
- Regrets -- I overvalued grinding, instead of doing it smartly. Watching+applying is more effective than just blindly trying to apply things over and over.

- Final project, internships, and downfall from competitive gaming
- Stopped joining tournaments, but still sometimes participated in Battle Cups, and doing ladder in World of Warcraft arena, etc.
- Around February/March, stopped playing Dota 2 and subscribing to World of Warcraft. Played games merely just for fun, like StarCraft II and Hearthstone
- Did not play an "actual game" since last month, because I do not have the time and drive anymore
- Casual games such as TypeRacer is always welcome

- Prize pool is big https://dota2.prizetrac.kr/, but need consistency througout the season. One moment of lapse will cost your team the tournament.
- Valve's official Dota 2 Major usually happens every 3 months. The prize pool for first place is 1M USD. Divide that with the team + org, each person probably gets $100k-$200k.
- For the last place, however, they only get US$62k. That's around $6k-10k with the same equation. So, US\$2k-3k per month, which is still good.

- However, "Getting lucky" in esports is as important as "getting lucky" in real sports.
- It's hard to be noticed by tier 2/3 team, let alone break through to tier 1 team, which usually are the prime contenders of the major.
- A person should be dedicating their life and time to the game. There's a lot to sacrifice.
- Other than winning tournaments, people can stream. But streaming is another tricky topic, because not all people can "gather" crowd and keep them interested. Also, it's not a guarantee whether non-tier 1 teams "pay" their players.
- esports is not as stable as real sports especially in these pandemic times. A team recently released all of their players (https://twitter.com/TeamGeekFam/status/1303649355736346624).

- a new life as a software engineer.
- how being software engineer could be "relaxing" at times, although there were some close calls, as well.
- creating work and life balance in marriage life.
