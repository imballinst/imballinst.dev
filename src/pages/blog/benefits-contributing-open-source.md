Hello, it's me again! It's been a while since my last post about [Leveling Up as a Frontend Engineer](https://imballinst.dev/blog/leveling-up-as-frontend-engineer), that was around 3 months ago. This time, I am going to share a bit on what I have gained from my small steps of contributing to open source projects.

For the record, my contributions so far were small ones. But, these small ones were good enough for me.
