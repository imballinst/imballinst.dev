Ho there! Hope you are doing well. Let's talk about context switch. It is one of the most used phrases in information technology (and not only software engineering), example case is when one is working but interrupted because of something else, reducing the productivity.

Without further ado, let's go!

## Context switching vs multitasking

I did a bit of research from few sources around the differences between context switching and multitasking, because I think it's important to learn about them before we delve further into the topic.

According to [this Asana article about the impact of context switch](https://asana.com/resources/context-switching), it _kinda_ follows the public understanding: context switch is about moving between multiple items and multitasking is about doing multiple things at the same time. Although, in another [Asana article about multitasking](https://asana.com/resources/multitasking), it says that multitasking is just context switches that happen rapidly.

Another [article from HubSpot about multitasking](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/forget-multitasking-try-context-switching) defines multitasking closer to the Asana's latter article rather than the former.

After reading those articles (and some others), I am more aligned with Asana's second article definition as well as HubSpot's. Although, probably there are another definition that lies in-between the 2 definitions above.
