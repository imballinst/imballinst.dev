Normally, we will have day and night take turns on a day-to-day basis. A sunny day will switch into a moonlit night. Light will shift into darkness. After the darkest of the night, universe will present us with dawn -- where shortly after, sun will rise back up.

However, darkness doesn't exist only during the night. Every certain period of time, a phenomenon called "Solar Eclipse" happens, where [a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the moon, which fully or partially blocks sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse).

How does this correlate with the real life? We all surely had certain period of time where we struggled. However, before that struggle happened, we _knew_ that we were going to struggle. We were expecting it.
