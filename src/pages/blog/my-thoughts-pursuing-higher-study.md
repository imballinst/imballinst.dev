This story is split into 3 parts. The first part is the preparation, the second part is the study itself, and the last part is the post-graduation.

## Preparation

The year was 2017. My father said that during his time, he didn't have the chance to pursue higher study because he lacked financial support. Now that he could afford me to pursue higher study overseas, he really wanted me to do it.

Another reason that he voiced was that due to the increasing competitions, people's degrees contribute a lot when applying for jobs. However, I didn't agree with this norm (and still don't), because degrees do not necessarily ensure that one is capable of creating positive impact.

There were 2 reasons why I finally decided to pursue higher study. The first one was that I respected my father's good will. The second was that I wanted to experience living abroad by myself. And so, I prepared for the upcoming enrollment in July 2018.

### Looking for Options

![Limited choices. Source: https://studentabroadmagazine.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/british-students-looking-at-foreign-options-to-avoid-large-fees/.](/img/looking-for-options.jpg)

The first thing I did was listing universities that I wanted, I could apply, and I could afford. I didn't want to do another subject other than Information Technology, so I was pretty much locked on it. Computer Science came close but I threw it out of the window because I was bad at mathematics and I didn't want to relive the undergraduate pain once more.

Most post graduate program required my undergraduate GPA to be at least 3.0 in the scale of 4. Since I didn't do well in my undergraduate, my choice was a bit limited. From my [search result in Top Universities in 2018](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/computer-science-information-systems), I found out that University of Melbourne, which at that time ranked 14th best, had lower GPA requirement (2.75 in the scale of 4), so that's a yep.

University of Melbourne's Information Technology course had Human-Computer Interaction as well, which aligned with what I did at that time, which was front-end web development. That's another yep.

Australia also seemed to be a new whole world to me at that time, as I had never experienced four seasons in a year before. That's the third yep.

Tuition fee and living cost... maybe not so much of a yep. At that time, a student could enroll in 4 subjects in a semester, with 12.5 credits each. For each 12.5 credits taken, the fee was 5.376 AUD (around 53M IDR). On top of that, apparently the living cost in Melbourne was quite high, especially when it comes to renting a place to live. I could cut this cost if I was willing to live with other people, but I valued _me-time_ so much. I couldn't afford to risk it in the long run.

### A Mountain to Climb

The hardest part of the preparation was passing the IELTS score needed to enroll in the University of Melbourne's School of Engineering. During that time, the minimum overall score was 6.5, with no aspect lower than 6.

The IELTS test fee itself was really expensive (215 USD ~= 2.8M IDR). To make it worse, it was a one-off. If I screwed it, I would need to re-attempt and pay for another test. I think it took around 3 months of preparation for me before I took it in December 2017.

There were 4 aspects tested. They are **listening**, **writing**, **reading**, and **speaking**. My speaking test was scheduled a day after the other written tests.

The test day finally came, and I thought I was doing quite well for the first three tests, so I approached the speaking test session with confidence. Long story short, I came into the room where the speaking test was held and began the conversation with the native speaker.

So, the [IELTS speaking test consists of three parts](https://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/take-ielts/prepare/free-ielts-practice-tests/speaking). The first part is questions around us and our family. In the second part, we will need to talk about a topic, while in the third part, we will discuss that topic with the examiner.

First part was relatively easy, but the second part turned the tide.

I was asked about **my favorite soap opera**. I still remember to this day, how confused I was when I heard the term "soap opera". It was definitely the first time I heard about it. Worse, I needed to do a monologue about it for 1 minute. The worst part, I needed to have a conversation about "soap opera".

It was the most random conversation that I have ever had to date, I think. I didn't even know what I was talking about and the person I had conversation with didn't want to explain about that to me.

I think it is safe to say that I did poorly in that test.

One month later, the result came out. I got 7.0 (listening), 7.0 (writing), 8.0 (reading), and 6.0 (speaking), with the overall 6.5. So, yay. I passed the IELTS score requirement.

### Registration and Visa Application

The next step was applying to University of Melbourne, with the IELTS result attached. I applied in January 2018 and waited for the announcement after. Their website told me that the selection process would start in late March.

Initially, I was confident. However, when I hadn't received any notification in early April, I began to worry and started looking for other options.

But, again, yay. Out of nowhere, I got the notification that my application was accepted. However, the roller coaster didn't end there. In order to complete my student Visa appliation, I needed to do a medical check-up. So, I made an appointment with a hospital that was recommended by Australian Embassy.

During the process, I told the doctor that I once had a Tuberculosis when I was around 10 years old. Then, the doctor said that my Visa application because of it. It felt really bad after all the effort that I had done if it had to end that way.

However, fate allowed my Visa to go through, and so I departed for Melbourne in July 2018.

## Hello, Melbourne!

![University of Melbourne Law School's Building has a pleasant surroundings. Photo by me.](/img/unimelb-law-building.jpg)

Now, just because I took a photo of the Law Building, it doesn't mean that I enrolled in that course. It is simply because it is one of the good photos that I took during my 1.5 years there. It is primarily because I didn't take photos frequently... and of course, because I'm not a good photographer.

Right, so, I spent first 2 weeks to find permanent accommodation. I took consideration of 3 aspects, **rent fee**, **distance to university**, **distance to markets**, and **travel costs**. If I was about to live in the suburbs, I could save some money from rent fee. However, the travel cost may be quite expensive. Tram and bus fares were at AU$4.30 for 2 hours (with daily cap at AU$8.60). It could be reduced if I bought a bike, but I would require to take care of it, as well.

After all things considered, I rented [a studio apartment](https://goo.gl/maps/2VkWnXXqXMwLdqqa9) which was 15 to 20 minutes walking time to university and supermarkets in CBD. The rent fee was at AU\$1439 per month, furnished and included electricity and water. The apartment was also equipped with free gym facilities. Just across of it, there was a big park and museum, which was coincidentally the examination venue at the end of the semester.

I don't think I regret renting that place. Sure, the cost was high, but I saved a lot of energy. I didn't have to depart way earlier, I didn't have to spend money on transportation, and I could just roll to get into the examination venue. The park was also a good running spot. If I decided to live in the suburbs, I would have saved probably AU\$200 per month, and I'm not sure whether that amount can make up for the convenience that I had.

### Living Style

I had a boring living style. Each weekend, I went to [Queen Victoria Market](https://qvm.com.au/) to get some seafood, eggs, fruits, and veggies. There was also a pet shop, so it was a great opportunity for me to see bunnies. After that, I went to the supermarket in CBD to get products that were not available in QV Market. Or maybe, they were available but I was too lazy to find it!

Anyways, in the supermarket, I usually bought rice, bread, chocolate spread/strawberry jam, frozen veggies, cereals, canned fish, milk, and many others. Sometimes, noodles and snacks were also on the list. Depending on the cycle, I usually spent AU\$20-30 per week for groceries in total.

What about food that I used to eat? Well... it was a very, very stale variation. The table below represents my eating "schedule" each week. Please note that this wasn't always the case, sometimes I skewed from this table because I was bored.

| Day  | Breakfast | Lunch                                   | Dinner                                  |
| ---- | --------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Sun  | Cereal    | Bread variations (sandwich/spread)      | Bread variations                        |
| Mon  | Cereal    | Potato salad                            | Bread variations                        |
| Tuey | Cereal    | Potato salad/bread variations           | Potato salad/bread variations           |
| Wed  | Cereal    | Rice, egg, veggies                      | Rice, egg, veggies                      |
| Thu  | Cereal    | Rice, egg, veggies/eat in a restaurant  | Rice, egg, veggies                      |
| Fri  | Cereal    | Salmon sushi (or rice+salmon when lazy) | Salmon sushi (or rice+salmon when lazy) |
| Sat  | Cereal    | Salmon sushi (or rice+salmon when lazy) | Bread variations                        |

That was really boring, wasn't it? I don't know, I have a very low standard of taste, so I prepared foods that were easy to make, easy to clean, and acceptable to eat. Less time cooking, more time doing other things!

### Networking

I tasted the first university life during the so-called "orientation" for Masters student. At that time, I still had this "motivation" to network to as many other students as I could. Guess what? I met a person, we exchanged numbers, but after that day we never talked anymore.

It was nearly the same when I was doing my undergraduate. People were encouraging to network, but it just won't happen with people who don't share a common interest with us. It's not their mistake, it's not our mistake. It's just not meant to happen.

During my undergraduate study, there was a tie that bound most, if not all students in a group together (a group can be school, faculty, course, or organization). Enrollment year was the top-level tie, followed by the group name. I think these commonalities helped us (or at least, me) to relate with each other.

This was not the case during my graduate study. People were not only coming from different countries, but they also had varying backgrounds. They had their own stuffs -- some had married, some were busy working part-time, and so on, and so forth. It was a completely different world. On top of that, the meeting time was very limited. If we meet a certain person in a certain class, although they were in the same stream as us, there might be a chance that we don't meet them in other classes in that semester, because they might be taking other subjects.

### Quality of Content

I can only speak for Information Technology course, Human-Computer Interaction stream, along with some other elective subjects. Generally speaking, I learned some new things in the classes. However, I don't think they were worth the money I had spent, as there were a lot more of things that I could have learned by myself.

Most of the subject coordinators were amazing. They did tremendous amount of preparation before a class so they could deliver their teaching material in the best way possible. I also enjoyed most of the tutorials and workshops because the tutors were interactive.

### Group Projects

I feel like I really need to share this. It's almost impossible to avoid a group project when we are doing our study. So, group projects were the most painful thing that happened to me during my university life. Why?

**Hierarchy was inexistent**. You know what happens when there is no hierarchy? Everyone gives their opinion and sometimes, it's really hard to decide without making them frown and making the situation uncomfortable. A group leader is not even a thing as well, as they can be easily manipulated by group members that are close to them.

**Meetings were ineffective**. Some of my group meetings were held for more than 3 hours. We were really inefficient of using our time because we didn't prepare for the meeting. During the meeting, we also didn't use a timer for each agenda, resulting in extended discussion, which most of the times wasn't necessary.

**Lack of tolerance**. Once, I had a group meeting that started in the afternoon and ended up in the midnight (around 3AM). The main task was to finish our report. However, again, we didn't prepare well for it before the meeting, as well as communicating it. There was a person who suddenly binned the draft document just because her part wasn't compatible with the shared document. As such, we needed to port the draft document to hers, which took some time. They didn't even ask whether I was okay getting home really late, as if as a student, going home late is normal.

Having said that, there were times where I teamed up with a really solid group project where everyone covered up for each other and discussed with patience. I think the negatives cloud the positives, though.

### Load of Assignments

Honestly, I don't see a difference between my undergraduate assignments and graduate assignments. Subject coordinators expected top quality deliverables, and to achieve that, usually students needed to spend more time than we should. To make it worse, each subject usually had 2-3 assignments within 3 months. Hence, there are 2 ways to achieve good grades: either you are a genius or you **overwork** doing your assignments.

I find it really weird when people are talking about burnout in their career, but why don't they talk about burnout in university life? I mean, when I'm getting burnout in my career, at least I'm getting paid for it. When I'm pursuing my study, however, I'm paying a lot and I'm getting burnout as a bonus. I don't think that's normal. I think it needs to change.

### Facilities

The facilities in University of Melbourne were awesome. Libraries were the most exceptional for me. Lightning fast internet speed, individual and group spaces, and water taps were all available inside the campus. Students could access religious facilities using their Student ID card, which was really handy. Classes were also equipped with adjustable lightings, so presentations had better visibility.

## Does it Worth?

TBD
