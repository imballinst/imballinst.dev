This story is split into 3 parts. The first part is the preparation, the second part is the study itself, and the last part is the post-graduation.

## Preparation

The year was 2017. My father said that during his time, he didn't have the chance to pursue higher study because he lacked financial support. Now that he could afford me to pursue higher study overseas, he really wanted me to do it.

Another reason that he voiced was that due to the increasing competitions, people's degrees contribute a lot when applying for jobs. However, I didn't agree with this norm (and still don't), because degrees do not necessarily ensure that one is capable of creating positive impact.

There were 2 reasons why I finally decided to pursue higher study. The first one was that I respected my father's good will. The second was that I wanted to experience living abroad by myself. And so, I prepared for the upcoming enrollment in July 2018.

### Looking for Options

The first thing I did was listing universities that I wanted, I could apply, and I could afford. I didn't want to do another subject other than Information Technology, so I was pretty much locked on it. Computer Science came close but I threw it out of the window because I was bad at mathematics and I didn't want to relive the undergraduate pain once more.

Most post graduate program required my undergraduate GPA to be at least 3.0 in the scale of 4. Since I didn't do well in my undergraduate, my choice was a bit limited. From my [search result in Top Universities in 2018](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2018/computer-science-information-systems), I found out that University of Melbourne, which at that time ranked 14th best, had lower GPA requirement (2.75 in the scale of 4), so that's a yep.

University of Melbourne's Information Technology course had Human-Computer Interaction as well, which aligned with what I did at that time, which was front-end web development. That's another yep.

Australia also seemed to be a new whole world to me at that time, as I had never experienced four seasons in a year before. That's the third yep.

Tuition fee and living cost... maybe not so much of a yep. At that time, a student could enroll in 4 subjects in a semester, with 12.5 credits each. For each 12.5 credits taken, the fee was 5.376 AUD (around 53M IDR). On top of that, apparently the living cost in Melbourne was quite high, especially when it comes to renting a place to live. I could cut this cost if I was willing to live with other people, but I valued _me-time_ so much. I couldn't afford to risk it in the long run.

### A Mountain to Climb

The hardest part of the preparation was passing the IELTS score needed to enroll in the University of Melbourne's School of Engineering. During that time, the minimum overall score was 6.5, with no aspect lower than 6.

The IELTS test fee itself was really expensive (215 USD ~= 2.8M IDR). To make it worse, it was a one-off. If I screwed it, I would need to re-attempt and pay for another test. I think it took around 3 months of preparation for me before I took it in December 2017.

There were 4 aspects tested. They are **listening**, **writing**, **reading**, and **speaking**. My speaking test was scheduled a day after the other written tests.

The test day finally came, and I thought I was doing quite well for the first three tests, so I approached the speaking test session with confidence. Long story short, the time comes, I came into the room and began the conversation with the person (who was a native speaker).

So, the [IELTS speaking test consists of three parts](https://takeielts.britishcouncil.org/take-ielts/prepare/free-ielts-practice-tests/speaking). The first part is questions around us and our family. In the second part, we will need to talk about a topic, while in the third part, we will discuss that topic with the examiner.

First part was relatively easy, but the second part turned the tide.

I was asked about **my favorite soap opera**. I still remember to this day, how confused I was when I heard the term "soap opera". It was definitely the first time I heard about it. Worse, I needed to do a monologue about it for 1 minute. The worst part, I needed to have a conversation about "soap opera".

It was the most random conversation that I have ever had to date, I think. I didn't even know what I was talking about and the person I had conversation with didn't want to explain about that to me.

I think it is safe to say that I did poorly in that test.

One month later, the result came out. I got 7.0 (listening), 7.0 (writing), 8.0 (reading), and 6.0 (speaking), with the overall 6.5. So, yay. I passed the IELTS score requirement.

### Enrollment Application and Visa Application

The next step was applying to University of Melbourne, with the IELTS result attached. I applied in January 2018 and waited for the announcement after. Their website told me that the selection process would start in late March.

Initially, I was confident. However, when I hadn't received any notification in early April, I began to worry and started looking for other options.

But, again, yay. Out of nowhere, I got the notification that my application was accepted. However, the roller coaster didn't end there. In order to complete my student Visa appliation, I needed to do a medical check-up. So, I made an appointment with a hospital that was recommended by Australian Embassy.

During the process, I told the doctor that I once had a Tuberculosis when I was around 10 years old. Then, the doctor said that my Visa application because of it. It felt really bad after all the effort that I had done if it had to end that way.

However, fate allowed my Visa to go through, and so I departed for Australia in July 2018.

Now, just because I took a photo of the Law Building, it doesn't mean that I enrolled in it. It is simply because it is one of the good photos that I took during my 1.5 years there.

The SCAA updated the wheel to reflect the finer nuances needed to describe flavors more precisely. The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.

While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. Weâ€™ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.

## What the updates mean to you

The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, is a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represents every segment of the specialty coffee industry, including:

- producers
- roasters
- importers/exporters
- retailers
- manufacturers
- baristas

For over 30 years, SCAA has been dedicated to creating a vibrant specialty coffee community by recognizing, developing and promoting specialty coffee. SCAA sets and maintains quality standards for the industry, conducts market research, and provides education, training, resources, and business services for its members.

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.
