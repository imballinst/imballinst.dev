_"Woah, woah, woah, hold on! This is the first post about therapist visit and you are telling me that this is part 4? Where are the previous 3 parts?"_ Unfortunately, for the first therapist visit, I was really all over the place. According to the therapist, my stories back then were unordered [timeline-wise], which is true, because I didn't know where to start. For the second and third visit, I did have a note but I forget where did I put it... so, yeah. Anyway!

## Topics

I made a proper preparation before visiting the therapist, because I wanted to make sure that I could get answers for whatever I was feeling at that time. Here were the list of things that I wanted to share:

### Relationship between health and stress level

In mid-October, my father teased that my rabbits [in my parent's home] were looking for me. I took that as he wanted me to visit him and my mother. At that time, I wasn't really on good terms with my mother because of the house-building stuff. I overthought that and the day after, I didn't feel quite good in the afternoon, and by night my body temperature was 37C. The next few weeks, yeah, I was battling with constant fever, up to 39.3C. I didn't tell my family about this... though my in-laws knew about this from my wife. That was more or less the same kind-of sickness that I was getting in February 2020. Fever, tick. Possible cause from stress, tick.

Two weeks since, I was still hesitating to go to hospital because of the pandemic condition. However, because my wife and her family pushed me [and also because I had seen her exerting so much effort in taking care of me], I gave up and so we went to the emergency room of the hospital. I got an infusion and the doctor prescribed me with some medicines, some for my fever, some for my nausea. From the full blood test, it appeared that I had some blood cells were in a not-so-good state, such as the red blood cells and platelets were lower than it should. It wasn't typhus or dengue... it was a common viral infection, my doctor said. Thankfully, I recovered in 1 week after that, though not fully fit yet.

With regards to this, the therapist said something about the relation between stress and platelet count. She said that she also faced the same thing in her life. In February, two years in a row, she was sick but the doctors couldn't figure out what the sickness was. What she knew was that her platelet count was lower than usual, but it was the same like me—neither it was typhus or dengue fever.

She figured out that during these times, her life was quite stressful. After that, in a conference related to psychology, she said that she met with Carl Jung's grandchild [if I remember correctly] and they told her that mental stress can impact blood cells, in particular platelets. So, probably that was the case for me twice last year (February and October).

Although what she said validates my concerns that mental health can affect health, which fed my ego because back then [there were people who said happiness doesn't affect health](https://peepohappy.id/blog/top3-achievements-frustrations-2020), I will still try to find references to ensure that what she said was valid. Bear in mind that I am not an expert in this field, so my thinking below **could** be wrong... and you don't have to agree with me.

Instead of finding facts that back up my therapist's argument, I found that [mental stress raises platelet activity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11481-020-09945-4)... which is probably a good thing? I looked up on [thrombocytopenia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thrombocytopenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20378293), a condition which someone has a low platelet count.

> Thrombocytopenia might occur as a result of a bone marrow disorder such as leukemia or an immune system problem. Or it can be a side effect of taking certain medications. It affects both children and adults.
>
> Thrombocytopenia can be mild and cause few signs or symptoms. In rare cases, the number of platelets can be so low that dangerous internal bleeding occurs. Treatment options are available.

In my case, thankfully my platelet count didn't drop too low to the extent that internal bleeding occurred. Since I didn't have bone marrow disorder, I looked up on [what might cause a problem on my immune system](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/news/20180619/severe-stress-may-send-immune-system-into-overdrive).

> Comparing more than 106,000 people who had stress disorders with more than 1 million people without them, researchers found that stress was tied to a 36 percent greater risk of developing 41 autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease and celiac disease.

After looking up on the list of autoimmune diseases... I don't think it fit my cases back then, as that list of diseases seems scarier than what I suffered. Back to the Mayo Clinic article:

> Platelets are produced in your bone marrow. Factors that can decrease platelet production include:
>
> - Leukemia and other cancers
> - Some types of anemia
> - Viral infections, such as hepatitis C or HIV
> - Chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy
> - Heavy alcohol consumption

Viral infections seem more like it, as my doctor said it was probably viral infection when I was getting my infusion. I know that viruses can't break through our body's immune system unless it is weaker than the virus, so I searched for more references and found the article, ["Stress, Illness and the Immune System"](https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html).

> When we’re stressed, the immune system’s ability to fight off antigens is reduced. That is why we are more susceptible to infections.

I also discovered similar fact from Healthline, ["Effects of Anxiety on the Body"](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/effects-on-body#Immune-system).

<!-- Insert the image from Heathline here. -->

> In the short term, this increases your pulse and breathing rate, so your brain can get more oxygen. This prepares you to respond appropriately to an intense situation. Your immune system may even get a brief boost. With occasional stress, your body returns to normal functioning when the stress passes.
>
> But if you repeatedly feel anxious and stressed or it lasts a long time, your body never gets the signal to return to normal functioning. This can weaken your immune system, leaving you more vulnerable to viral infections and frequent illnesses. Also, your regular vaccines may not work as well if you have anxiety.

I think this was also what my therapist said to me during our session (but I forgot to write it down). So, I guess, "mental health impacts physical health" is a valid argument? Maybe. But, even if you don't think it is because there hasn't been any thorough research about it, I suggest you to be kind to people, that's all. It's simple, really. What does it cost for you to be good to people? None.
