_"Woah, woah, woah, hold on! This is the first post about therapist visits and you are telling me that this is part 4? Where are the previous 3 parts?"_ Unfortunately, for the first therapist visit, I was all over the place. According to my therapist, my stories back then were unordered [timeline-wise], which is true, because I didn't know where to start, I didn't know what my problems were, and I didn't know how to explain them. For the second and third visit, I did have a note but I forget where did I put it... so, yeah. Anyway!

## Topics

I made proper preparation before visiting the therapist because I wanted to make sure that I could get answers for whatever I was feeling at that time. The sections below were things that I consulted with my therapist.

### Relationship between health and stress level

In mid-October, my father teased that my rabbits [in my parent's house] were looking for me. I took that as he wanted me to visit him and my mother. At that time, I wasn't really on good terms with my mother because of the house-building stuff. I over-thought that and the day after, I didn't feel quite good in the afternoon, and by night my body temperature was 37°C. The next few weeks, yeah, I was battling with constant fever, up to 39.3°C. I didn't tell my family about this... though my in-laws knew about this from my wife. I had a similar sickness back in February 2020. Fever, tick. Possible cause from stress, tick.

Two weeks later, I was hesitating to go to the hospital because of the pandemic condition. However, because my wife and her family pushed me [and also because I had seen her exerting so much effort in taking care of me], I gave up and so we went to the a hospital. I was admitted to the emergency room. I received an infusion and had my blood tested in the laboratory.

From the full blood test, it appeared that my blood cells weren't in a good state, the red blood cell count was quite low and the platelet count was at the low-end of the normal range. It wasn't typhus or dengue fever... it was just a common viral infection, the doctor said. That was a relief. My fever disappeared in around 3 days after that.
