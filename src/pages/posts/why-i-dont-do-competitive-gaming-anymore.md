That was mostly it -- we competed in bigger Indonesian tournaments, but since we were mostly students and did not dedicate 100% of our time to "train", we were clearly behind compared with other top-tier teams from Indonesia.

I have regrets over those times. I overvalued grinding and I forgot the value of watching and learning. Yes, applying what we have learned is important, but as much as putting them into practice is important, we can also get insights by watching how other players play and do their stuff. Perhaps, if I "studied" other top-tier players inside and outside Indonesia, I could have become a better player.

## Turning Points

The year was 2016. I needed to do another internship in order to do my thesis defense because I procrastinated from working on my previous internship report. This caused my university internship supervisor to be "mad" at me and I thought there was no second chance. So, I expected another 1-2 months of suffering. Anything I would do to graduate that year.

I was so wrong when I expected my path on competitive gaming would still be the same before, during, and after the internship.

Truth be told, I knew almost nothing when I first applied for an internship at [eFishery](https://www.efishery.com). My portfolio only consisted of two small sites that I worked on, [a JavaScript-based clock that changes background based on timezones](https://imballinst.github.io/javascript-timezone) and [RIP THE DREAM's team page](https://imballinst.github.io/rtdota2). But, for some reason, the company accepted my application. That was the first good thing.

The second good thing was, I found a really good mentor during my internship. He guided me in a way so that I could pave my way to understand and catch-up to the newer world of web development. Slowly, I began comparing the "career" of front-end engineer with competitive gamer. By the end of the internship, I was offered a part-time opportunity and I took it.

This job was unlike competing in tournaments, I thought. It was chill, urgent at times, but my stress-level was not as high as when I was inside a tournament game. Also, better "salary"? Sign me up. I decided to stop doing tournaments, though sadly that also stopped my team from competing further. However, I was still playing DotA 2, in particular for Battle Cups (prior to The International event), as well as World of Warcraft for its Arena PvP.

As for now, I don't play both games anymore. I only play Hearthstone during my spare time for fun and that's it, though I still follow a bit of DotA 2 and World of Warcraft from Twitch streamers and/or tournaments out there. No matter how different my current job with what I did in the past, I will always have a soft spot for video games.

## Prospects in Esports

Let's talk about prospects. For DotA 2 prize pool alone, [it is quite big](https://dota2.prizetrac.kr/) for a team game. In fact, The International 2019, as of July 2020, [is still the tournament with the highest prize pool](https://www.statista.com/statistics/517940/leading-esports-tournamets-worldwide-by-prize-pool/). Of course, there are also other games with big prize pools as well, such as Fortnite and League of Legends.

However, most of these tournaments only come yearly. You have one shot to get the big prize. If you don't win, you don't get paid (unless your team pays you as a player). If you or your team have an immense amount of talent and dedication, I think you should give it a shot. However, in esports, you also need to be lucky, just as how professional athletes in sports do.

Sure, if we take a look at [some of the top football players' earnings](https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/the-14-best-paid-footballers-in-the-world-2020), we will think that, _"Oh, it's going to be so nice to be a football player!"_. But, the road to become one of them is definitely not as easy as it looks. First, you will need to be dedicated. Then, you will need to "ramp up" in local football teams, then you hope to be noticed by leagues outside of your country. If you plan to become a Premier League player, you probably would need to play in less-competitive Europe leagues first. You need to be consistent, you need to be free from injuries, which sometimes, are career-defining for a lot of football players.

Whether you are going for sports or esports, you will need to dedicate your life for it. Sometimes, it will require sacrifice. It's not easy to get the best of all worlds when you are chasing or doing your dreams.

In esports, other than winning tournaments, one can also try to stream their gameplay. Streaming is another tricky topic. Not all famous players can gather crowds to watch their gameplay. It requires social skills and consistency [to stream on schedule]. However, if you succeed in both aspects, you have a chance in building your own community who will subscribe or even donate to you for making their day.

One thing for sure, I don't think esports at the moment is as stable as real sports especially during these pandemic times. A team recently [released all of their players](https://twitter.com/TeamGeekFam/status/1303649355736346624) due to the uncertainty of the DotA 2 tournaments. Also, usually Valve held a lot of DotA 2 major on-site tournaments in a year. However, due to this COVID-19 situation, there are only online tournaments and their prize pools are not as big as official Valve’s DotA 2 major tournaments.

## Now, I am...

The year is 2020. Currently, I am working as a front-end engineer at [Tetrate.io](https://www.tetrate.io/) and I am quite happy with it. I have flexible working hours, I am getting experience working with people around the globe, I am getting good amounts of money, and again, my stress level is not as high as when I am competing in a tournament.

One day, I hope esports will become on-par with real sports. I hope families and society will adapt to this industry and accept that playing games can be a career. Now, I’m working on another dream. A dream to build a healthy family -- physically and emotionally.
