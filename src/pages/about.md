My name is Try Ajitiono. I do frontend engineering and creating bugs on daily basis, mostly around React. I was once a semi-professional Dota 2 gamer (I competed mostly online, though), hence I love video games. Also, bunnies üê∞.

## Behind "peepohappy"

In [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv), there are a lot of emote types. They are **global emotes**, **channel emotes**, and **custom emotes**. Custom emotes are created by users and extendable through [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/) or [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/).

I have a lot of favorite emotes, such as [WutFace](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wutface), [KEKWait](https://www.rivalry.com/esports/what-does-kekwait-mean), [OMEGALUL](https://www.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/128054-OMEGALUL), and [SMOrc](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/smorc). However, [widepeepoHappy](https://www.slanglang.net/widepeepohappy/) tops them all. It almost always makes me smile seeing that emote appear in Twitch Chat. In addition, deeper inside me, I want to be a happy person. Therefore, I dedicate the name of this site to "peepohappy", because widepeepohappy would be too long for a name.

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is mainly to **share**. Currently, the content revolves around my posts, but in the future, this may change. Sometimes, my posts may have this _rant_ vibes, however, I will try to make them as civil as possible. If you want to consume the less "civilized" version, perhaps you might want to visit my Twitter account instead.
