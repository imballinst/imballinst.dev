My name is Try Ajitiono. I do frontend engineering and creating bugs on daily basis, mostly around React. I was once a semi-professional Dota 2 gamer (I competed mostly online, though), hence I love video games. Also, bunnies üê∞.

### Behind "peepohappy"

In [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv), there are a lot of emote types. They are **global emotes**, **channel emotes**, and **custom emotes**. Custom emotes are created by users and extendable through [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/) or [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/).

I have a lot of favorite emotes, such as "WutFace", "KEKWait", "OMEGALUL", and "SMOrc". However, "widepeepoHappy" tops them all. It almost always makes me smile seeing that emote appear in Twitch Chat. In addition, deeper inside me, I want to be a happy person. Therefore, I dedicate the name of this blog to "peepohappy", because widepeepohappy would be too long for a name.

### Purpose

The purpose of this blog is mainly to **share**. Sometimes, my posts will have this _rant_ vibes, however, I will try to make them as civil as possible. If you want to consume the less "civilized" version, perhaps you might want to visit my Twitter account instead.
